        <h1>Merge Sort Algorithm</h1>
        <p>
            In this article, we will discuss the merge sort Algorithm. Merge sort is the sorting technique that follows the divide and conquer approach. This article will be very helpful and interesting to students as they might face merge sort as a question in their examinations. In coding or technical interviews for software engineers, sorting algorithms are widely asked. So, it is important to discuss the topic.
        </p>
        <p>Merge sort is similar to the quick sort algorithm as it uses the divide and conquer approach to sort the elements. It is one of the most popular and efficient sorting algorithm. It divides the given list into two equal halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. We have to define the merge() function to perform the merging.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Divide:</strong> The array to be sorted is divided into two halves. This process continues until each subarray contains only one element. This is the base case of the recursion.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            <strong>Conquer:</strong> Once the array is divided into single-element subarrays, the merging process begins. Pairs of subarrays are merged in a sorted order. The merging process is repeated until a single sorted array is obtained.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            <strong>Merge:</strong> During the merging process, two subarrays are merged into a single sorted subarray. This is achieved by comparing the elements of the two subarrays and merging them in the correct order.
        </p>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Create an auxiliary array to store the merged result.</li>
            <li>Compare the elements of the two subarrays, and insert the smaller (or larger, depending on the sorting order) element into the auxiliary array.</li>
            <li>Move the index of the array from which the element was taken.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process until all elements from both subarrays are merged into the auxiliary array.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p>
            <strong>Repeat:</strong> Steps 1-3 are repeated recursively for each pair of subarrays until the entire array is sorted.
